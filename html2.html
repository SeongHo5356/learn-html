<p>Practicing html is fun.
 so far we have learned HTML is a language made of tags and help us describe how we want our webpages to look.
 We have tried the head, title, H(heading),<br>
 <em>and paragraph tags so far</em>.<strong> Very few peoeple know all the tags in HTML, but that</strong><br> 
 is okay because we can do a lot with just some basic tags.
 we can learn about new tags when we need them </p>
